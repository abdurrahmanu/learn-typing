1. connect to same network - wifi / hotspot
2. Add "host": "vite --host" in package.json scripts / change server setting inside vite.config.js too with this setting
  server: {
    host: true
  }

3. vite will automatically use your ip as the server ip, 
4. run the command with npm run host
5. access your app in external device, just use {your ip}:{port} eg: 192.168.10.1:5173.
