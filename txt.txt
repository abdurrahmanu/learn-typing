** if ID does not exist remotely -> delete and create new ID || use that ID to save remotely
** user auth
** leaderboard

it has been long so the codebase is looking strange even though I wrote it.

** countdownStore and timerStore have to be merged or refactored to be one entity
** one central source of truth should be maintained for every dependency 
** check network connection before sending to db to avoid errors

** will come back for capslock in inputEvent.js
** clearly understand the use of enterKey.value

** wrongCoutn doesnt reduce, -- think it is from backspace
